    "The first type of error considered was energy relaxation, in which an excited qubit decays into the ground state over time. The process is modeled as an exponential decay; the time constant of the decay is termed T1 and is an important performance characteristic for quantum computing. A sample circuit for measuring T1 across two qubits is shown below.\n",

    "## Multi-qubit Gate Error\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth type of error considered was a multi-qubit gate error. This type of error was characterized using the randomized benchmarking suite in the Qiskit Ignis module. Ignis was used to generate randomized gate sequences of varying length that should leave the qubits in the ground state. However, due to gate errors, as the sequences grow longer, the the ground state population decays; the time constant of this decay is termed *r*. Although it is not immediately clear what *r* measures (see [Proctor et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.01853.pdf)) and IBM does not provide any official calibration values, comparing our values for *r* across different qubits on the same device is potentially meaningful. An example of an experimental run is shown below.\n",
