    "The first type of error considered was energy relaxation, in which an excited qubit decays into the ground state over time. The process is modeled as an exponential decay; the time constant of the decay is termed T<sub>1</sub> and is an important performance characteristic for quantum computing.\n",

    "The detailed/commented source code for this experiment can be found in `T1_Variations.ipynb`; the results are summarized here. The basic methodology for each experiment is to initialize a qubit in the excited state and then apply varying durations of idle gates and record the remaining excited state population:\n",
